                    <h3>difference between local storage and session stroage:</h3>
                    <p>sessionStorage is similar to localStorage ; the difference is that while data in localStorage
                        doesn't expire, data in sessionStorage is cleared when the page session ends. Whenever a
                        document is loaded in a particular tab in the browser, a unique page session gets created and
                        assigned to that particular tab.</p>

                    <h3>What is difference between global scope and local scope?:</h3>
                    <p>A global variable has global scope. A global variable is accessible from anywhere in the code.
                        Local Scope — Local scope contains things defined inside code blocks. A local variable has local
                        scope.</p>

                    <h3>how to work js event loop:</h3>
                    <p>The Event Loop has one simple job — to monitor the Call Stack and the Callback Queue. If the Call
                        Stack is empty, the Event Loop will take the first event from the queue and will push it to the
                        Call Stack, which effectively runs it. Such an iteration is called a tick in the Event Loop</p>

                <div class="container mt-5 text-bg-primary p-5 rounded-4 ">
                    <h3>undefined :</h3>
                    <p>undefined is a property of the global object. That is, it is a variable in global scope. The
                        initial value of undefined is the primitive value undefined.In all non-legacy browsers,
                        undefined is a non-configurable, non-writable property. (Even when this is not the case, avoid
                        overriding it.) A variable that has not been assigned a value is of type undefined. A method or
                        statement also returns undefined if the variable that is being evaluated does not have an
                        assigned value. A function returns undefined if a value was not returned.</p>
